L2 regularization adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the weights.

L1 regularization is more effective at preventing overfitting than L2 regularization. However, L1 regularization can also make the neural network more sparse. This means that some of the weights in the neural network will be zero.

L2 regularization is less effective at preventing overfitting than L1 regularization. However, L2 regularization does not make the neural network as sparse.

20. How can early stopping be used as a regularization technique in neural networks?

Early stopping is a technique that can be used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Early stopping works by stopping the training of the neural network early, before it has had a chance to overfit the training data.

Early stopping is effective because it prevents the neural network from learning the noise in the training data. This can help the neural network to generalize better to new data.

21. Describe the concept and application of dropout regularization in neural networks.

Dropout regularization is a technique that can be used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Dropout regularization works by randomly dropping out some of the neurons in the neural network during training. This means that the neural network will not be able to rely on any one neuron too much.

Dropout regularization is effective because it prevents the neural network from becoming too sensitive to the noise in the training data. This can help the neural network to generalize better to new data.

22. Explain the importance of learning rate in training neural networks.

The learning rate is a parameter that controls how much the weights of a neural network are updated during training. The learning rate must be set carefully, as a too high learning rate can cause the neural network to diverge, while a too low learning rate can cause the neural network to take a long time to converge.

The optimal learning rate depends on the specific neural network architecture and the problem that the neural network is being trained to solve. It is important to experiment with different learning rates to find the optimal value for the specific neural network.
